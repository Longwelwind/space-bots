# Asteroid Mining

Asteroid belts in systems can be mined with mining ships to extract ores, which can then be
refined into higher-value resources.
Mining is a nice way for new players to gain credits and to get access to other, more
lucrative, game activities.

Before mining asteroids, you must first find a system with an asteroid belt. To do so, use
`GET /systems/{systemId}` and check if the field `asteroid` is set. For example:

```sh
curl https://space-bots.longwelwind.net/v1/systems/mega-torox \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $SPACE_BOTS_API_TOKEN" | json_pp
```

```json
{
  "id": "mega-torox",
  // ...
  "asteroid": {
    "miningResourceId": "aluminium_ore",
    "yield": "VERY_LOW",
    "size": "ENDLESS"
  }
}
```

The asteroid belt in `mega-torox` can be mined for `aluminium_ore`. It has a `VERY_LOW` yield and is `ENDLESS`.

To mine this asteroid belt, move a fleet to this system and call `POST /fleets/{fleetId}/mine`.
Your fleet will be busy mining the asteroid belt for a few seconds, then the ore will be available in the fleet's cargo.

## Mining power of a fleet

How much ore will be mined from an asteroid is defined by the mining power of a fleet,
which is the sum of the mining power of all the ships in the fleet.

The mining power of a ship type can be found by calling `GET /ship-types`.

## Yields

The `yield` field of the asteroid belt describes how much ore will be extracted by a mining ship with a mining power of 1.
There are 5 levels of yields:

| Name | Yield |
|--|--|
| `VERY_LOW` | 1 |
| `LOW` | 2 |
| `MEDIUM` | 3 |
| `HIGH` | 4 |
| `VERY_HIGH` | 5 |

Asteroid belts with higher yields are generally found far from the center of the galaxy.

## Sizes

The `size` field indicates how much ore can be mined from this asteroid before it is exhausted. There are 4 sizes:

| Name | ore |
|--|--|
| `SMALL` | 1000 |
| `MEDIUM` | 2000 |
| `BIG` | 3000 |
| `ENDLESS` | Infinite |

`ENDLESS` asteroids are never exhausted and can always be mined for ores.

Asteroid belts replenish every minute, allowing for new ores to be mined.
