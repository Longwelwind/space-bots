# Station Modules

Players can build modules in space station that allows you to perform some tasks like crafting, building ships and others.

Different types of modules can be built inside a space station, each offering different kind of services. To see the list
of module types that can be built, use `GET /module-types`.

                    "cost": {
                        "credits": 10000
                    }
                    // ...

A station module type has a kind, as indicated in the `kind` field, which describes what kind of services this
station module type provides. Refineries (recognized by the value `refinery`), for example, makes it possible to refine resources into higher-value resources.

A station module type has different levels that can be built. All levels must be built in order and each have
a credit cost, and possibly a list of ressources necessary to be built.

Depending on the kind of module type, the elements in the `levels` field will contain additional information about
what each level unlocks specifically. For refineries, for example, each level may unlock
additional blueprints which can be used in this station.

## Building or upgrading a station module

To build a station module, use the endpoint `POST /systems/{systemId}/modules/{moduleType}/build`. Your inventory
in this station should contain the necessary resources in order to build the station module.

Once you have built the first level of a station module, you can upgrade it to the next level by
using the same endpoint.

## Interacting with a station module

Each module type kinds have different ways to be interacted with, and the following pages describes them:

-   [Refineries](/docs/station-modules/refineries)
-   [Shipyards](/docs/station-modules/shipyards)
