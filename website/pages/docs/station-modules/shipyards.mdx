# Shipyards

Shipyards are station modules that can build ships to add in your fleets.
When listing the different types of modules with `GET /v1/modules-types`, refineries are
module types with `shipyards` as `kind`.

## Blueprints

A blueprint is a recipe that describes what resources are needed to build a ship.
The available blueprints for a given shipyard are given by the endpoint `GET /v1/module-types`.

                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "cost": {
                        "credits": 1000
                    }
                },
                {
                    "cost": {
                        "credits": 10000
                    },
                    "blueprints": [
                        {
                            "credits": 50,
                            "inputs": {
                                "mithril": 4
                            },
                            "shipTypeId": "fighter"
                        }
                    ]
                }
                // ...
            ]
        }
        // ...
    ]
}
```

Each level of a refinery gives access to a number of blueprints. Here, for example, building the `small-shipyard`
allows you to build `miner` ships, at the cost of 2 `mithril` and 50 credits.
Upgrading the shipyard to level 3 allows you to build `fighter` ships, at the cost of 4 `mithril` and 50 credits.

## Build ships

To build a ship using your shipyard, use the
`POST /v1/systems/$SYSTEM_ID/station/modules/$MODULE_TYPE_ID/build-ships` endpoint. Use `shipTypeId` to specify which
ship you want to build. `fleetId` should be one of your fleet located in the same system as the
station module. You can build multiple ships with one call, provided you have the credits and the resources,
by specifying`count`. (1 by default).

```sh
curl -X POST https://space-bots.longwelwind.net/v1/systems/$SYSTEM_ID/station/modules/$MODULE_TYPE_ID/refine \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $SPACE_BOTS_API_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"fleetId": "$FLEET_ID", "shipTypeId": $SHIP_TYPE_ID}' | json_pp
```

```json
{
    "status": "ok"
}
```
