# Getting Started

First, head to the [User zone](/user), log in, and get your API key.
To re-use it in future commands, we'll save it inside a environment variable

```sh
export SPACE_BOTS_API_TOKEN=spbo_yourtoken
```

When you logged in for the first time, the game created a fleet for you. List your fleets by doing:

```sh
curl https://space-bots.longwelwind.net/v1/fleets/my \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $SPACE_BOTS_API_TOKEN" | json_pp
```

```json
[
    {
        "capacity": 10,
        "cargo": {},
        "currentAction": null,
        "id": "$FLEET_ID",
        "locationSystemId": "omega",
        "owner": {
            "type": "user",
            "userId": "$USER_ID"
        },
        "ships": {
            "miner": 1
        }
    }
]
```

Notice that this fleet is composed of a `miner` ship, that is located in the `omega` system and that it doesn't contain anything in their cargo.
Note down the `id` of this fleet, in the folowing step, it will be refered as `$FLEET_ID`.

You can get information about the system `omega` by executing:

```sh
curl https://space-bots.longwelwind.net/v1/systems/omega \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $SPACE_BOTS_API_TOKEN" \
    | json_pp
```

```json
{
    "id": "omega",
    "name": "Omega",
    "neighboringSystems": [
        {
            "systemId": "sigma"
        },
        {
            "systemId": "tashornia"
        },
        {
            "systemId": "mega-torox"
        },
        {
            "systemId": "legaka"
        }
    ],
    "station": {
        "directSell": true,
        "buyShips": true,
        "cargo": {}
    },
    "x": 0,
    "y": 0
}
```

Notice that this system has 4 neighbouring systems, and that it doesn't contain any asteroid belt (as seen by the absence of a `asteroid` field)

Let's get information about `mega-torox`, one of the four neighbouring systems:

```sh
curl https://space-bots.longwelwind.net/v1/systems/mega-torox \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $SPACE_BOTS_API_TOKEN" | json_pp
```

```json
{
    "asteroid": {
        "miningResourceId": "aluminium"
    },
    "id": "mega-torox",
    "name": "Mega Torox",
    "neighboringSystems": [
        {
            "systemId": "omega"
        },
        {
            "systemId": "duovin-anaon"
        }
    ],
    "x": 2,
    "y": 2
}
```

We can see that this system has an asteroid belt containing `aluminium`!

Let's move our fleet to `mega-torox`:

```sh
curl -X POST https://space-bots.longwelwind.net/v1/fleets/$FLEET_ID/travel \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $SPACE_BOTS_API_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"destinationSystemId": "mega-torox"}' | json_pp
```

```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "arrivalTime": "2023-11-05T12:01:22.794Z"
}
```

Your fleet will take some time before arriving to `mega-torox`.

Wait until your fleet has arrived to `mega-torox`, and then order it start mining the asteroid belt:

```sh
curl -X POST https://space-bots.longwelwind.net/v1/fleets/$FLEET_ID/mine \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $SPACE_BOTS_API_TOKEN" | json_pp
```

```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "finishTime": "2023-11-04T13:00:44.207Z",
    "duration": 4
}
```

It will also take some time before your fleet has finished mining the asteroid.
You can check the status of the fleet by executing:

```sh
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer $SPACE_BOTS_API_TOKEN" \
    https://space-bots.longwelwind.net/v1/fleets/{fleet_id} | json_pp
```

```json
{
    "cargo": {
        "aluminium": 1
    },
    "currentAction": null,
    "id": "$FLEET_ID",
    "locationSystemId": "mega-torox",
    "owner": {
        "type": "user",
        "userId": "$USER_ID"
    },
    "ships": {
        "miner": 1
    }
}
```

Notice that there is now 1 aluminium in the cargo of your fleet!

Travel back to the original system

```sh
curl -X POST https://space-bots.longwelwind.net/v1/fleets/$FLEET_ID/travel \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $SPACE_BOTS_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"destinationSystemId": "omega"}' | json_pp
```

```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "arrivalTime": "2023-11-05T12:01:22.794Z",
    "duration": 4
}
```

Let's sell this aluminium in the station

```sh
curl -X POST https://space-bots.longwelwind.net/v1/fleets/$FLEET_ID/direct-sell \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $SPACE_BOTS_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"resources": {"aluminium": 1}}' | json_pp
```

```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "creditsGained": 10
}
```

<Callout type="info">
    Resources can also be sold on the player market by calling
    `/systems/omega/market/resources/aluminium/instant-sell` if others players
    have placed buy orders, but `/fleets/$FLEET_ID/direct-sell` provides a flat
    price for which you can sell your resources.
</Callout>

And voila! You have mined, and sold, your first resources in Space Bots!

But this is not over! There are a lot of things that can be done in Space Bots:

-   You can try to automate mining and selling resources using your favourite language of choice
-   You can explore the universe to find systems where more valuable resources can be mined
-   You can start building [Station Modules](/docs/station-modules) to refined the resources you've mined and to
    start building ships with the refined resources.
