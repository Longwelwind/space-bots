# Fleets

Fleets are player-owned groups of ships. They can travel through systems and are used to do most of the
economic activities of the game.

## Moving fleets

Fleets can be moved between systems by calling the `POST /v1/fleets/FLEET_ID_1/travel`, and specifying the
target system in the request's body. A fleet can only travel to an adjacent system of its current location (
the adjacent systems of a system can be found by calling `GET /v1/systems/{systemId}`).

For example, to move a fleet located in `omega` to `mega-torox`:

```sh
curl -X POST https://space-bots.longwelwind.net/v1/fleets/FLEET_ID_1/travel \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $SPACE_BOTS_API_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"destinationSystemId": "mega-torox"}' | json_pp
```

```json
{
    "status": "ok",
    "arrivalTime": "2023-11-05T12:01:22.794Z"
}
```

The move will take a certain amount of time depending on the distance between the 2 systems (the position of a
system can be found with `GET /v1/systems/{systemId}`).

## Cargo

Fleets can carry resources in the cargo of the ships that compose it. The content of a fleet's cargo and its capacity
can be fetched by getting the info about a fleet. For example, calling `GET /v1/fleets/FLEET_ID_1` returns:

```json
{
    "id": "FLEET_ID_1",
    "capacity": 100,
    "cargo": {
        "aluminium": 20
    }
    // ...
}
```

In this case, this fleet contains 20 `aluminium` and has a capacity of 100.

A fleet's cargo capacity is determined by the ships that compose it. Each ship can carry a certain amount
of resources based on its ship types (the exact value can be found by calling `GET /v1/ship-types`). The cargo
capacity of a fleet is the sum of the cargo capacity of all its composing ships.

## Transferring resources and ships

Resources and ships can be transfered between fleets by using `POST /v1/fleets/{fleetId}/transfer`.
The content of the request describes which ships and resources are transfered.
For example, calling `/v1/fleets/FLEET_ID_1/transfer` with:

```json
{
    "targetFleetId": "FLEET_ID_2",
    "resourcesFromFleetToTarget": {
        "aluminium": 10
    },
    "resourcesFromTargetToFleet": {
        "iron": 5
    },
    "shipsFromFleetToTarget": {
        "miner": 20
    },
    "shipsFromTargetToFleet": {
        "fighter": 3
    }
}
```

Will transfer 20 `miner` ships and 10 `aluminium` from `FLEET_ID_1` to `FLEET_ID_2`,
and transfer 3 `fighter` and 5 `iron` from `FLEET_ID_2` to `FLEET_ID_1`.

Not having enough cargo capacity to achieve this transfer will result in a `not_enough_cargo_capacity` error.

## Split an existing fleet

Splitting an existing fleet can be done using the same endpoint
described in [the previous section](#transferring-resources-and-ships), but by ommiting
the `targetFleetId` argument.
